# Conestoga_Client_Server_Chat_Prototype
Client Server Chat program with message queues. 
Collaboration with fellow student, JMarkic for Windows and Mobile Programming class. 

# PROGRAMMERS : JMarkic and lpcSetProg
# FIRST VERSION : 2016-11-15

# Description:
This file contains the source code for a chat system that allows two or more 
users to communicate with one another on multiple computers. The communication between the two 
people is managed by a separate program called the 'Server'. Users have the option of private chats,
broadcast chats, or group chats, depending on how they make their selection of users. All users
of the chat program may end their session gracefully without disrupting the server. 

NOTE: Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) technology  must be enabled in Windows to run.
